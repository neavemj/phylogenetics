# AIV Pipeline Phylogenetics Module
---

Module to take assembled influenza genomes and produce a phylogenetic tree.

Input:
* Assembled influenza genomes from the IRMA module.
* A backbone set of sequences from MySequences or NCBI to use in the tree.
    * This set of sequences needs to be pre-compiled into a multi-fasta file and might need to be regularly updated.

Output:
* A phylogenetic tree rendered as a png image.
    * Make sure the tree is sized appropriately for the reporting module.
